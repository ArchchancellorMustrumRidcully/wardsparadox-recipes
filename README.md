Due to the way I handle my commits (Being stupid a lot and still new to git) I often handle a multiple commit fix with a " or "" to signify using the previous commit message to explain my changes, usually a subtle fix for formatting or a mistake on my part. I will try to handle the latest "commit" here as well. I also will only be comitting when the testing branch has succedded in being put into production.

Hello,
This repo hosts recipes for Autopkg (http://github.com/autopkg/autopkg) developed by WardsParadox.
The recipes are all munki import based, not useful otherwise really. Feel free to clone to
make regular download recipes.
Thanks,
Ward aka Zack
