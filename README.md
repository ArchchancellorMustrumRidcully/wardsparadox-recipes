Autopkg-recipes
===============
Latest Update (2015-05-12):
Added DupeGuru.Munki, Added AirServer.munki (Uses sheagcraig's AirServer.download as a parent Recipe, make sure you have it as a REPO autopkg repo-add sheagcraig-recipes)

Update 2015-03-08:
Fixed AdwareMedic.munki's issue with the SparkleFramework. Was un-archiving wrong and using the wrong format processor of tar_gzip for some odd reason. Sorry for inconvenience.


Due to the way I handle my commits (Being stupid a lot and still new to git) I often handle a multiple commit fix with a " or "" to signify using the previous commit message to explain my changes, usually a subtle fix for formatting or a mistake on my part. I will try to handle the latest "commit" here as well. I also will only be committing when the testing branch has succeeded in being put into production.

(Sorry for any potential spam of this Repo)
Hello,
This repo hosts recipes for Autopkg (http://github.com/autopkg/autopkg) developed by WardsParadox.
The recipes are all munki import based, not useful otherwise really. Feel free to clone to
make regular download recipes.
Thanks,
Ward aka Zack
